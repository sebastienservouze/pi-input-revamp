# @nerisma/pi-input-revamp

Replaces [pi](https://pi.dev)'s input editor with a **full rounded frame**, a
colored **π** prompt character, and a **session metrics bar** built into the
border.

The border and the π use the active theme's `accent` color. Each of the four
corners of the border is a **quadrant** you fill with the info elements you want
— agent, model, cost, context usage, per-turn metrics, and more. By default the
top bar shows session-wide info and the bottom-right shows the last turn, but the
whole layout is configurable (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

## Installation

```bash
pi install npm:@nerisma/pi-input-revamp
```

Or via `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "packages": ["npm:@nerisma/pi-input-revamp"]
}
```

## Configuration

The layout and animations are driven by `~/.pi/pi-input-revamp.json`. The file is
created with the defaults on first run, so you can just edit it. Missing fields
fall back to the defaults, and changes are picked up on the next pi restart.

```json
{
  "layout": {
    "topLeft": ["agent", "model", "thinking-level", "cwd", "duration", "tools", "tok"],
    "topRight": ["session-label", "ctx-percent", "ctx-tokens-full", "session-cost", "session-out", "session-hit", "session-miss"],
    "bottomLeft": [],
    "bottomRight": ["turn", "turn-duration", "turn-cost", "turn-out", "turn-hit", "turn-miss"]
  },
  "animations": {
    "typingPulse": true,
    "submitFlash": true,
    "metricPulse": true,
    "tokPulse": true
  }
}
```

### Layout

Each quadrant — `topLeft`, `topRight`, `bottomLeft`, `bottomRight` — is an ordered
list of element IDs joined with ` · `. Elements that have no data (e.g. a model
that isn't set, or a turn that hasn't completed) are skipped silently, so empty
quadrants simply collapse into the border.

| Element            | Shows                                                              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent`            | Active agent name (`PI_ACTIVE_AGENT`)                             |
| `model`            | `provider/id` of the current model                                |
| `thinking-level`   | Thinking level (hidden when `off`)                                |
| `cwd`              | Working directory (`$HOME` collapsed to `~`)                      |
| `duration`         | Elapsed session time (`5m 12s`)                                    |
| `tools`            | Number of tools actually sent on the last request (`12 tools`)    |
| `tok`              | Live token estimate of the text you're typing (`~42 tok`)         |
| `session-label`    | The literal `SESSION` tag                                          |
| `ctx-percent`      | Context window usage as a percentage (`12.3%`)                    |
| `ctx-tokens`       | Context tokens in use (`15.2K`)                                    |
| `ctx-tokens-max`   | Context window size (`200K`)                                       |
| `ctx-tokens-full`  | Used / max (`15.2K/200K`)                                          |
| `session-cost`     | Whole-session cost in `$`                                          |
| `session-out`      | Whole-session output tokens (`OUT 8.3K`)                           |
| `session-hit`      | Whole-session cache-read tokens (`HIT 2.1K`)                       |
| `session-miss`     | Whole-session input / cache-miss tokens (`MISS 1.2K`)             |
| `turn-cost`        | Last completed turn cost in `$`                                    |
| `turn-out`         | Last completed turn output tokens (`OUT 8.3K`)                     |
| `turn-hit`         | Last completed turn cache-read tokens (`HIT 2.1K`)                 |
| `turn-miss`        | Last completed turn input / cache-miss tokens (`MISS 1.2K`)        |
| `turn`             | Turn number with metric-update count (`T5 (3)`)                   |
| `turn-duration`    | Duration of the last completed turn (`12s`)                       |

Every element is self-contained: the `session-*` variants always report
whole-session totals and the `turn-*` variants always report the last completed
turn, regardless of which quadrant you place them in.

### Animations

Each effect can be toggled independently under `animations`:

| Key           | Effect                                                                |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `typingPulse` | Border and π lerp toward white the faster you type                    |
| `submitFlash` | Brief white border pulse when you submit (text goes non-empty → empty) |
| `metricPulse` | Metric text pulses toward white when its value changes                |
| `tokPulse`    | The `~N tok` counter pulses each time the estimate updates            |

The thinking equalizer (the `▁▂▃…█` bar shown while the model works) is always on.

## How it works

The extension registers a custom editor on `session_start` (and hides the
default footer), subclassing pi's `CustomEditor` and overriding `render(width)`.

**From-scratch rendering.** Instead of calling `super.render()` and
post-processing, it builds every line itself. It reserves columns for the `│`
borders and the ` π ` prefix, then calls the inherited `layoutText()` to
word-wrap the input (which keeps paste markers and grapheme segmentation
intact). The cursor is drawn by inverting the grapheme under it (`\x1b[7m…`),
and each line is padded to the inner width and wrapped in border characters. The
top and bottom borders are produced by `fitRoundedBorder`, which fits a left and
a right text into one line, truncating them when space runs short.

**Session metrics.** On each render it reads the session entries from
`ctx.sessionManager.getEntries()` and aggregates token usage and cost (whole
session, and the current/last turn separately). Context usage comes from
`ctx.getContextUsage()`.

**Tool count.** The extension subscribes to `before_provider_request` and keeps
a reference to the `tools` array packed into the request payload. The count is
read lazily at render time, after the whole hook chain has run, so it reflects
any in-place filtering other extensions apply (for example MCP-bridged tools
that inflate the active set but never reach the wire) and reports exactly what
was sent on the last request. Before the first request it falls back to
`pi.getActiveTools()`.

**Color animations.** Several effects share a brightness engine that parses an
ANSI foreground color to RGB and re-emits it in the **same** terminal mode
(truecolor or 256-color), so the animation is never a no-op on 256-color
terminals:

- *Typing whitening* — characters added are sampled over a sliding window to
  estimate WPM; the border and π lerp toward pure white the faster you type,
  with a fast attack and an exponential release when you stop.
- *Submit flash* — a non-empty → empty text transition triggers a brief white
  border pulse.
- *Metrics pulse* — when the session metrics change, the metric text pulses
  toward white and decays back.
- *Thinking equalizer* — while the model works, a VU-meter bar (`▁▂▃…█`) and a
  status word animate on their own line, driven by an independent sinusoid so
  the border stays at the fixed accent.

Animations run on short `setInterval` timers that request a re-render and stop
themselves once the effect has fully decayed; all timers are cleared in
`dispose()`.
